### [0:15 - 1:00] THE SOLUTION - Semantic Search

**Narrator:** "When you search, ChatIO doesn't just match keywords - it understands context, intent, and semantic relationships."

**[Screen: User types "What was decided about payment limits?"]**

**Narrator:** "Watch this: I search for 'payment limits'..."

**[Screen: Search results appear with similarity scores]**

**Narrator:** "ChatIO finds messages that are semantically related, even if they use different words. Notice the similarity scores - these aren't just keyword matches, they're AI-powered relevance rankings."

**[Screen: Results show messages about "transaction caps", "spending restrictions", "payment thresholds"]**
